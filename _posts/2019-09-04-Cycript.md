## How to use Cycript  

* 1.Install Cycript from Cydia !!! `DO NOT Trust some people on the Net says use .deb That's so Stupid!`
* 2.Now you can just SSH to your devices! And enter 

	`Terminal:`{:.info} 

	> Cycript -p "PROC_NAME" 

	to trace the process even hook to some function! 

* 3.Until now ,you need a document of this plus-in ,But I need to tell you first that it a script-language of OC & JS !!!

	This is a official [document](http://www.cycript.org).

	_That's why i do not write this md on Chinese ---- make you used to read English._
* 4.of course we need a way to see the app's output on someway 

	we use the  `"syslog to /var/log/syslog"` this cydia-plus-in
